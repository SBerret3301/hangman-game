# hangman-game
<p align="center">Yes, this code implements a simplified version of the classic game Hangman. In Hangman, the player tries to guess a word by suggesting letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman is drawn. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before they lose the game.

In this code, the word is represented by asterisks, and the player tries to guess the letters one by one. If a guessed letter is correct, it replaces the corresponding asterisk. If a guessed letter is incorrect, a counter is incremented, and after 5 incorrect guesses, the game is over.

The game continues until either the player guesses all the letters correctly or makes 5 incorrect guesses. At the end of the game, the program provides feedback on whether the player won or lost. If they make 5 incorrect guesses, they lose. If they guess all the letters correctly, they win.

This code is a text-based implementation of Hangman. If you want to play the game, you can run this code in a Python environment, and it will prompt you to enter letters to guess the word.</p>
